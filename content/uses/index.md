This page is inspired from [@wesbos'](https://wesbos.com/), [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) page.  
This section was planned from the beginning of this blog.  
Now it's finally happening.  
This post lists all the tools and equipment I use day in and day out.  
Some tools/tech I am using may not be ideal for everyone, But they are somehow working for me. Please don't take this as any sort of recommendation.

- **Hardware**  

  I currently have three powerful machines:  
  My Personal, My Workstation and My Home server ðŸ’™
  - **My Home Server**: The Home Server was the first computer I used, which my parents bought for me in 2009.
            It still has the same configuration and holds a special place in my heart as it was the first computer
            I used for my personal use. It has been a great learning experience for me, as I started my first programming and learned about Linux and Open Source using this machine.  
            Now I am using this as my media server, more about it can be seen here [Media Server Setup](/post/my-media-server-setup/).  
            I am self-hosting some services in it like Jellyfin, Deluge,
            Calibre, Sonarr, Radarr, Jacket ...etc. more about it can be read here
            [Things I Self Hosting](/post/things-i-self-hosting/)  
    - CPU: Intel i3-2100 (4) @ 3.100GHz
    - RAM: 2Â GB
    - OS: Debian 10 (buster)
    - Storage: 500 GB HDD
    - More [Neofetch Output](/images/uses/media_server_neofetch.png)
  - **My Personal Machine**: This is the first laptop I bought, which helped me a lot during my college days.
        Right from the beginning, it was running on Linux. I tried several Linux-based operating systems on this device.
        Like everyone else, I started with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). I used Ubuntu for a long time, then moved to [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) to understand the rolling release ecosystem.
        After that, I tried [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) to challenge myself. Now, from experience, I believe that [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) is the most stable OS out there.  
        All the dev stickers I received from meetups and conferences are stuck on this laptop. Now I regret it; the laptop cover looks messy.
    - ThinkPad E470
    - CPU: Intel i3-6006U (4) @ 2.000GHz
    - RAM: 24 GB (Initial 8 GB, recently added 16 GB More)
    - OS: Debian 11 (bullseye) Will move to 12 soon
    - Storage: 256 GB SSD
    - More [Neofetch Output](/images/uses/personal_neofetch.png)
  - **My Workstation**: This will change according to places I am working. Currently, it's a ThinkPad.
        In my work place also I prefer to use Debian as my choice of operating system.  
    - ThinkPad E14 Gen 2
    - CPU: 11th Gen Intel i7-1165G7 (8) @ 4.700GHz
    - RAM: 16 GB
    - OS: Debian 11 (bullseye)
    - Storage: 500 GB SSD
