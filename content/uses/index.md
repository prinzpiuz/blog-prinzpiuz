## Tools & Tech Stack âš’

This page is inspired by [@wesbos'](https://wesbos.com/), [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) page.  
This section was planned from the beginning of this blog.  
Now it's finally happening.  
This post lists all the tools and equipment I use day in and day out.  
Some tools/tech I am using may not be ideal for everyone, but they are somehow working for me. Please don't take this as any sort of recommendation.  
***
This page is a work in progress, if you are curious about anything else in my setup shoot me a toot [@prinzpiuz](https://elk.zone/aana.site/@prinzpiuz)
