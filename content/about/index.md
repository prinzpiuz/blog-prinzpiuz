## Me

Hi, I am prinzpiuz. I consider myself to be an atheist and a freethinker who puts trust and hope in science.
Currently, I'm living in [VarapuzhaüèùÔ∏è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varappuzha) | [Kochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernakulam_district) | [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) | [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)  
I'm a software engineer, currently working for [Nuventure Connect](https://nuventureconnect.com/).

Previously I worked for

- [Tridz](https://tridz.com/) as a system admin

I started this blog for sharing my Tweaks | Hacks | DIYs  
I like reading very much (mostly science and history books/blogs). Also,  
I'll be watching movies/tv-shows in my free time.
