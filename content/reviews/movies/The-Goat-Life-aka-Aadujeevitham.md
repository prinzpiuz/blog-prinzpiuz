This is my first movie review. After watching this film, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. This cinema surpasses the standards of not only Malayalam but Indian cinema as well.  

The film [Aadujeevitham]([text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadujeevitham_(film))) is based on a novel of the same name by author [Benyamin]([text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benyamin_(writer))). The story is inspired by a true incident from the life of a man named Najeeb, who hails from a small village in Kerala, India.

This movie is a survival drama set in the scorching deserts of Saudi Arabia during the 1990s, directed by [Blessy]([text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessy)). The interesting fact is that Blessy has been preparing for this movie since 2009, and since then, fans have been eagerly anticipating its release. Actor [Prithviraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithviraj_Sukumaran), the main protagonist of the movie, underwent an incredible [transformation]([text](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/prithviraj-sukumaran-fast-for-72-hours-aadujeevitham-transformation-would-drink-water-black-coffee-9224895/)) which further increased the anticipation for the movie. And the Movie released worldwide on 2024 March 28, I got a chance to watch one of the first shows itself. And it's simply awesome, The movie exceeded expectations and set a new benchmark for Malayalam cinema, a testament to the dedication of the crew.  

##### Plot Summary

The movie is about Najeeb, played by Prithviraj, and his struggle for survival in the harsh desert of Saudi Arabia. Najeeb is a sand miner in his hometown, but he got an opportunity to work as an office helper in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, something goes wrong during his journey, and he ends up as a goatherd in the middle of the desert. The movie follows his journey as he navigates the challenges of surviving in the desert.

##### What I Liked About the Movie  

What I liked most about the movie was the excellent scripting and the dedication of the crew to creating something special. This movie is a great example of teamwork.  
Blessy, the director, did an excellent job of adapting a novel into a film. He was able to depict every aspect of Najeeb's life in a very natural way. In the first half of the movie, we see how Najeeb comes to terms with his destiny in the desert. Through clever scripting, the director was able to convey Najeeb's emotions to the audience. He achieved this by showcasing Najeeb's hometown and his love story with his wife. The audience can feel Najeeb's pain through these scenes. In the second half of the movie, the audience is kept on the edge of their seats in a survival thriller.  
The performance of actors in a movie is crucial for its success. In this movie, the actors were exceptional, and it felt like they were living their roles. [Prithivi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithviraj_Sukumaran) performance was refined, mature and extraordinary. His dedication to the movie, especially his weight loss, was remarkable. [Amala Paul]([text](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3898762/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t6)), who played Sainu, also gave an excellent performance, and her chemistry with Prithivi was beautiful. They conveyed Najeeb's feelings of being far away from home without hope of seeing his loved one again. [K.R. Gokul](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15975295/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t3), who played Hakim, also did a great job and underwent a similar transformation to Prithiviraj for the movie. [Jimmy Jean-Louis]([text](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1097515/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t2)), who played Khadiri, and [Talib]([text](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15975296/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4)) and [Rik Aby](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4317833/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t5), who played Khafil and his assistant respectively, also gave extraordinary performances. Overall, every actor did their best, which contributed to the movie's success.  
Next, let's talk about the background score and songs in the movie. Personally, I was eagerly waiting for the release of the background score and songs, especially since this marks `[AR Rahman's]([text](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006246/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr)) comeback to Malayalam cinema. I had high expectations for the songs, and they did not disappoint, particularly the credit track [Periyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnzA2TnOMIU). As for the background score, I believe it plays a crucial role in the movie. Rahman did an excellent job of creating a connection between the movie and the audience through his music.  
The background score I am playing in the background is called [Benevolent Breeze]([text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mswKO3lLkUo)), and it creates a calming effect on the mind when heard in the movie.  
The sound design of the movie [Rasool Pookuty](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1017076/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr), another Oscar winner from India and a great sound designer, is awesome. Rasool has done an excellent job in capturing the sounds of the desert and conveying its harshness to the audience. His work is very useful in helping us understand what a desert sounds like.  
During the movie, the VFX was handled by a team called Anibrain. The vulture scene and snake multiplying scenes were particularly realistic.  
The next round of applause should go to the cinematography team. I say this because, although the story may not resemble Dune, the way the movie has been shot and the color grading used make it feel like an Indian version of Dune. I must say, Mr. [Sunil K.S](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9767152/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) and [K.U. Mohanan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595933/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) has done an excellent job in this regard.  
Mr. Ranjith Ambady has done an excellent job with the makeup in the movie. The actors, especially Prithvi, looked outstanding. The makeup played a crucial role in conveying the pain of Najeeb to the viewers which was executed perfectly.  
Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude towards all the assistant directors, the art department, finance department, and everyone else who contributed towards making this movie a success.  

##### Why I Suggest this movie

I would like to recommend this movie that I believe sets a new benchmark not only for Malayalam cinema, but also for Indian cinema as a whole. The movie is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire team involved in its creation, particularly the director, Mr. Blessy, and the lead actor, Prithviraj. It is truly exceptional and well worth watching.
