Aavesham Movie is directed and written by [Jithu Madhavan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8527635/), known for ["Romancham"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20249418/).
Aavesham reintroduces [Fafa](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1335704/) as Ranga, a local gangster from [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). The movie follows three teenagers as they meet Ranga and their lives afterwards.  

##### What I Liked About the Movie  

It's all about performance. Fafa's acting was unique when he simply exploded as Ranga. No one in the movie could match FaFa's energy and vibrant performance.  
I really enjoyed watching this movie! The combination of actors was special, particularly the scenes featuring Fafa and [Sajin Gopu](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13205277/), who played the role of Amban. Additionally, the teenage actors who were already popular on social media, delivered exceptional performances in this film.  
One more thing I want to mention is the exceptional direction by Jithu, which provides a completely cinematic and thrilling experience throughout the movie. Additionally, the screenplay of the movie is one of the finest in the Malayalam film industry. In my opinion, this is a unique movie in the Malayalam dark comedy genre.  
The movie's music and background score, composed by [Sushin Shyam](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5444706/), play a crucial role in delivering an edge-of-the-seat experience. Sushin' music is so hip that it really ups the game in the mass scenes and as bgm.  
[Samir Tahir](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2569351/), a proven genius and hitmaker, beautifully handled the cinematography.  

##### My Verdict  

I would rate this Malayalam cinema 4.8 out of 5, as it is a unique masterpiece.
