So this blog is my personal opinion on recent [ban](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/india-bans-59-chinese-apps-border-dispute-200629180545547.html) of apps in India, Due to the border conflicts with China.
Openly saying I am against this ban, rather than ban people must aware about consequences of using such closed source apps.
And people must aware that not only apps in this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_apps_banned_in_India) raise security issues said by the Government, all those closed source apps out there raises different kind of security and privacy issues to us as a individual

* ###### **Importance of Your Data**
    Data has been described as the new oil of the digital economy, different type of data about an individual grouped together can act as digital double of that person, Next question is what kind of data, so everything about you is a data like, what you eat,drink, see, listen, browse, like, dislike, your health, where you go ?, everything you do, is data about you  

* ###### **Who is looting/taking it from you ?**
    The **[GAFAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)** companies. when comparing tik-tok to the data these companies taking from us, we can understand how small was tik-tok and other banned app's  user base was, even they are also looting us... what people forgetting is 
    > **_"If You're Not Paying For It, You Become The Product"_**

    so I am trying to make list of open alternatives for the famous closed source application and services
